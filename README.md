# FoRmation

> FoRmation is a shell script to set up a macOS laptop for design, development, and R. It is entirely based on Mina Markham's excellent [Formation](https://github.com/minamarkham/formation). It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Install

Download the script:

```sh
git clone git@github.com/ajaypillarisetti/formation.git && cd formation
```

Review the script (please don't run scripts you don't understand):

```sh
less slay
```

Slay:

```sh
cd formation
./slay 2>&1 | tee ~/slay.log
```
Just follow the prompts and youâ€™ll be fine.

:warning: Warning: I advise against running [this script](slay) unless you understand what itâ€™s doing to your computer.

Mina created this based on her own preferences; I updated it to include things I need for work, including R, Creative Cloud, and other stuff. Your mileage will vary.

Once the script is done, quit and relaunch Terminal.

It is highly recommended to run the script regularly to keep your computer up to date.

Your last FoRmation run will be saved to `~/slay.log`. To review it, run `less ~/slay.log`.

## ðŸŒ¶ Just add `~/.hot-sauce`

Your `~/.hot-sauce` is added at the end of the FoRmation script. Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

NERDFONTS_RELEASE=$(curl -L -s -H 'Accept: application/json' https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest)
NERDFONTS_VERSION=$(get_github_version $NERDFONTS_RELEASE)

NERDFONTS=(
    SpaceMono
    Hack
    AnonymousPro
    SourceCodePro
    Inconsolata
)

step "Installing fontsâ€¦"
for font in ${NERDFONTS[@]}; do
    if [ ! -d ~/Library/Fonts/$font ]; then
        printf "${indent}  [â†“] $font "
        wget -P ~/Library/Fonts https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/$NERDFONTS_VERSION/$font.zip --quiet;unzip -q ~/Library/Fonts/$font -d ~/Library/Fonts/$font
        print_in_green "${bold}âœ“ done!${normal}\n"
    else
        print_muted "${indent}âœ“ $font already installed. Skipped."
    fi
done

step "Installing R Packages"
for package in $(<$cwd/swag/rpackages); do
    if [ ! -d /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/library/$package ]; then
        printf "${indent}  [â†“] $package "
        Rscript ~/Documents/formation-pillarisetti/swag/install_packages.R $package
        print_in_green "${bold}âœ“ done!${normal}\n"
    else
        print_muted "${indent}âœ“ $package already installed. Skipped."
    fi
done
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.

FoRmation functions such as `step` and `link` can be used in your `~/.hot-sauce`.

## Known Issues
Cask does not recognize applications installed outside of Homebrew Cask â€“ in the case that the script fails, you can either remove the application from the install list or uninstall the application causing the failure and try again.
